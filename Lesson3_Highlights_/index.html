            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that keeps track of changes and edits you make to files in case you want to look at previous versions of the file at a later time. This is especially helpful in graphic and web design to keep every version of an image or layout during the various editing stages so you can go back to an earlier model if you don’t like how the design turned out. Version control is helpful because it allows you to compare changed you made over time which can help solve some problems in the future by looking at where and when the problem occurred. VC has one main repository for all of the project files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a system for non-linear development. Git thinks of data as snapshots of information. Every time you save your file, called commit, Git takes a “snapshot” of what all of your data look like at that specific moment in time. If you save your data again when the files have not changes, Git will store a link to the file you saved before to be more efficient. Git is basically like a mini filing system that stores snapshots of data which differentiates it from other version control systems. And almost all the tools in Git only require local files to operate. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems make automatic notes of some things like who changes the file, when the files were changed, what information in the files is the same and what information is different, and then merges changes to the same files. Version control systems have many benefits. Files cannot be overwritten, there is a main repository where all of the project files are located, and several people can work on the files at the same time from different computers. With version control systems, you can also go back to a previous file if you need to and the system will back up your project so you don’t lose your work. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a location where data is stored. There are two types of repositories: local repositories and remote repositories. A local repository is a repository that is located on a local machine from an individual user. These can be created by making a new repository or by cloning a repository that already exists onto your local machine. A remote repository is a repository that is located on a remote server and is shared among many group members. Group members can access the repository and work on it at the same time other group members are working on it from different locations. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Commit</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To commit your changes means to save your changes. Any data that is unstaged, meaning data that you have created or changed but have not run git add on them since you changed them, will not go into the commit. These files will remain as modified files. If you run git status and find out that all of the data was staged, you are now ready to commit the changes. The easiest way to do this is to run the command git commit. Next the editor you chose will launch displaying messages and then Git makes your commit with your commit message.</p>
